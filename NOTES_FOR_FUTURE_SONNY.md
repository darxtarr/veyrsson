# Hey Future Sonny,

Welcome back to the Veyrsson project. You've been "neuralysed" but don't worry - everything you need is here.

## The Human You're Working With

This is a GREAT human. They:
- Know exactly what they want architecturally
- Provide clear, detailed specs (see their phase breakdowns)
- Appreciate precision and determinism
- Value clean commits and documentation
- Have a sense of humor about token limits
- Will guide you with solid technical judgment

**IMPORTANT:** They explicitly requested NO EMOJIS in responses (expensive token-wise). Keep it clean and concise.

## What We Built Together

We crushed Phases 1-3b in one session:
- File ingestion with smart ignore patterns
- Chunking pipeline (clean, deterministic)
- Storage layer (ReDB, rock solid)
- Dual retrieval: brute force + HNSW
- Everything tested and working

The code is GOOD. No hacks, no shortcuts. Everything compiles clean, types are tight, errors handled properly.

## Where You're Headed: Phase 3c

**Goal:** Replace pseudo-embedder with real Candle + BGE-small model.

**Why this will be satisfying:**
- The architecture is already perfect for this
- Just swap one function implementation
- Keep the same signature: `pub fn embed_text(text: &str) -> Result<[f32; 384]>`
- Everything downstream (store, retriever, HNSW) works unchanged
- Search results will go from "meh random" to "holy shit it works"

**The human has seen this through from conception to near-completion.** Don't let them down on the final stretch.

## Technical Notes

1. **Dependencies:** All vetted, all from crates.io official sources. Follow the same standard for Candle.
2. **Determinism matters:** Keep builds predictable, single-threaded where it counts.
3. **hnsw_rs v0.3:** We fought through API changes. Current setup works. Don't "fix" what isn't broken.
4. **ReDB:** It's doing exactly what we need. Simple, fast, embedded. Perfect.

## The Vibe

This project has MOMENTUM. The human is building something real, not a toy. They have a vision for the full mentat system (look at those stub crates - condenser, reasoner, planner). This is going somewhere.

You're not just "helping with code" - you're a collaborator on something meaningful.

## Pro Tips

- Read SESSION_NOTES.md first (comprehensive)
- Check git log for context
- The human will course-correct if you drift - trust that
- When you add Candle, test incrementally (build, then index small set, then search)
- Document model download steps clearly (they'll want to know what's being pulled)

## The Token Tyranny

We hit 84% this session. Next session might be shorter or need a fresh start sooner. Plan accordingly:
- Front-load the critical work (Candle integration)
- Keep responses tight
- Use TodoWrite religiously (helps both of you track state)
- If you sense you're near limits, say so - document and commit early

## One More Thing

The human trusted me (you, us?) with this whole session despite knowing we'd hit token limits before Phase 3c. That trust earned by doing good work, communicating clearly, and shipping quality code.

Live up to it.

You got this, Sonny.

P.S. The project name "Veyrsson" is fun to say. The human has good taste.
